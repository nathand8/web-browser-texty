# CS 6968 Template

This repository is a template for your work in CS 6968.

To grade your lab tests, I'll be checking out the `tests/labN`
directory, as of the deadline. You don't need to do anything to submit
them except commit and push. Each directory has an empty `.gitignore`
file in it. You can ignore this file; I needed to create it for Git to
track the containing directory.

As for the rest of the repository, feel free to set it up however you
like. If you store your browser source code here, it might be easier
for me to help you out in office hours or similar, but if you'd rather
keep the code elsewhere that's fine too.
